# Milestone 4 Reflection

You can find both of our apps:
DashPy - [here](https://dsci532-2022-mindthegap.herokuapp.com/)
DashR â€“ [here]()

## Introduction 
Overall we are quite happy with the final result, as we believe it is very easy to use both of our DashPy and DashR apps. We have created two sets of dashboards that are very user friendly and easy to understand. The interactions between the filter selections and the graphs are all working seamlessly and the users should be able to derive the information they need. The feedback we received from another peer group also aligns as we were told that DashPy is easy to use and read. We were also able to improve the DashPy according to our plan outlined in Milestone 2 reflection and these enhancements are summarized as below.   

## DashPy improvement 
Our improvements on DashPy during Milestone 4 were focused on improving the layout of the dashboard and improving the functionality of the graphs. We moved the year slider from the control panel to the top of the dashboard for better visibility and changed the design of control panel for better aesthetics. We also enhanced functionality of all of our graphs, including adding tooltip and extra tabs for some of the charts and improving the interactivity of the global map as we planned during Milestone 2. 

One of the valuable feedback that we received was the fact that some of our plots were missing the tooltip. To better convey the information and achieve consistency across all the graphs, we went ahead and added the tooltip for additional charts as mentioned above. Another valuable point was on the layout of the graphs, noting how different layout options could better utilize the space and deliver the information. For example, it was suggested to have the bar graph next to the global map instead as they are more related to each other. This is an excellent feedback and we will consider to change them in the next opportunity. 

## DashR deployment
We tried to replicate the DashR as closely as possible to DashPy so that both dashboards will display the same graphs, metrics, and layouts. We achieved this goal by using similar structure of codes to build the control panel and the layout but in a different format applicable. It is not to say that DashR is perfect, as DashPy was deployed two weeks earlier and had more time to be improved. DashR still needs to be worked on in terms of its aesthetics, layouts, and functionality of each chart, but still we are satisfied to launch a working version of the initial app.
